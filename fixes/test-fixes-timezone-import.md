# Test Fixes: Missing Timezone Import

## Problem Description

The test suite was failing with 3 errors in the `banktransactions/tests/test_automation/test_scheduler_deduplication.py` file. All errors were related to a missing `timezone` import:

```
NameError: name 'timezone' is not defined
```

The errors occurred in the `mock_email_config` fixture where `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` was being used without importing `timezone`.

## Diagnostic Steps

1. Ran the full test suite with `pytest -v` to identify failing tests
2. Identified that all 3 errors were in the same file: `banktransactions/tests/test_automation/test_scheduler_deduplication.py`
3. Examined the file and found that `timezone` was being used but not imported
4. Located the specific line causing the issue: line 51 in the `mock_email_config` fixture

## Root Cause

The file was importing `datetime` and `timedelta` from the `datetime` module but was missing the `timezone` import:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta  # Missing timezone
```

This caused a `NameError` when the fixture tried to use `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`.

## Solution Applied

Updated the import statement in `banktransactions/tests/test_automation/test_scheduler_deduplication.py` to include `timezone`:

```python
# Before
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# After  
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone
```

## Verification

After applying the fix:
- Ran the specific test file: `pytest banktransactions/tests/test_automation/test_scheduler_deduplication.py -v` - All 6 tests passed
- Ran the full test suite: `pytest -v` - All 506 tests passed, 7 skipped, with only warnings (no errors)

## Impact

This fix resolved all 3 test errors without affecting any other functionality. The tests now properly import the `timezone` module needed for timezone-aware datetime operations.

## Lessons Learned

- Always ensure all required modules are imported when using datetime operations with timezone awareness
- The `timezone` module is separate from `datetime` and `timedelta` and must be explicitly imported
- Test fixtures should be carefully reviewed for missing imports, especially when using timezone-aware datetime operations

## Prevention

- Consider adding linting rules to catch missing imports
- Review import statements when adding new datetime operations that require timezone awareness
- Ensure test fixtures are properly tested in isolation

# Refactoring: Duplicate Code Removal Between Backend and Banktransactions

## Problem Description

The `kanakku` project had significant code duplication between the `backend` and `banktransactions` modules, specifically:

1. **Duplicate EmailConfiguration Model**: The `EmailConfiguration` SQLAlchemy model was defined in both:
   - `backend/app/models/other.py` (authoritative definition)
   - `banktransactions/automation/email_processor.py` (duplicate standalone definition)

2. **Duplicate Encryption Functions**: Encryption/decryption logic was duplicated in:
   - `backend/app/utils/encryption.py` (Flask-context aware functions)
   - `banktransactions/automation/email_processor.py` (standalone duplicate functions)
   - `banktransactions/core/email_parser.py` (another standalone duplicate)

3. **Duplicate GlobalConfiguration Model**: Similar duplication in `banktransactions/core/email_parser.py`

## Root Cause

The duplication occurred because the `banktransactions` module needed to work independently of Flask application context for background job processing, leading developers to create standalone versions of backend functionality rather than creating shared utilities.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Consolidated Encryption Utilities

**Enhanced `backend/app/utils/encryption.py`**:
- Added `get_encryption_key_standalone()` function that works without Flask context
- Added `decrypt_value_standalone()` function that works without Flask context
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing Flask-context functions

### 2. Removed Duplicate Model Definitions

**Updated `banktransactions/automation/email_processor.py`**:
- Removed duplicate `EmailConfiguration` class definition (lines 118-130)
- Removed duplicate encryption functions (`get_encryption_key_standalone`, `decrypt_value_standalone`)
- Added import: `from app.models import EmailConfiguration`
- Added import: `from app.utils.encryption import decrypt_value_standalone`

**Updated `banktransactions/core/email_parser.py`**:
- Removed duplicate encryption functions
- Removed duplicate `GlobalConfiguration` class definition
- Added proper imports from backend modules

### 3. Improved Import Strategy

Instead of complex path manipulation and model duplication, the modules now:
- Import models directly from `app.models`
- Import encryption utilities from `app.utils.encryption`
- Use proper Python path management for cross-module imports

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All model definitions and encryption logic now exist in one place
2. **Reduced Maintenance Burden**: Changes to models or encryption logic only need to be made once
3. **Consistency**: No risk of models or functions diverging between modules
4. **Cleaner Code**: Removed ~80 lines of duplicate code across multiple files
5. **Better Testing**: Shared functionality can be tested once and reused

## Files Modified

1. `backend/app/utils/encryption.py` - Enhanced with standalone functions
2. `banktransactions/automation/email_processor.py` - Removed duplicates, added imports
3. `banktransactions/core/email_parser.py` - Removed duplicates, added imports

## Testing Performed

- Verified backend encryption functions can be imported successfully
- Verified backend models can be imported from banktransactions context
- Confirmed no breaking changes to existing functionality

## Future Improvements

This refactoring addresses the first three high-priority items identified in the analysis:
1. ✅ Remove duplicate `EmailConfiguration` model definition
2. ✅ Consolidate encryption utilities
3. ✅ Improve import strategy (see `fixes/import-strategy-improvements.md`)

Remaining improvements for future consideration:
4. Create shared database utilities
5. Create unified service layer

## Lessons Learned

- When modules need to work independently of application context, create context-agnostic versions of shared utilities rather than duplicating code
- Establish clear import patterns early in multi-module projects
- Regular code reviews should check for duplication across module boundaries

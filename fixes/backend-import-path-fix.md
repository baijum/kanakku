# Backend Import Path Issue Fix

## Problem Description

The backend module had import path issues when imported directly from outside the `backend` directory. The error manifested as:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'
```

This occurred in files like `backend/app/accounts_bp/routes.py` when trying to import:

```python
from app.extensions import api_token_required, db
```

## Root Cause

The backend codebase was designed to work with absolute imports starting with `app.*`, which only work when the `backend` directory is in the Python path. The pytest configuration included `pythonpath = ["backend"]` which made tests work correctly, but direct imports from the project root failed.

## Diagnostic Steps

1. **Reproduced the issue**: Attempted to import backend modules from the project root
   ```bash
   python -c "from backend.app.accounts_bp.routes import accounts_bp"
   # Failed with ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'
   ```

2. **Identified the scope**: Found 100+ files using `from app.*` imports throughout the codebase

3. **Analyzed existing patterns**: Discovered that the `shared` module already had a similar solution using `sys.path` manipulation

4. **Verified pytest configuration**: Confirmed that `pythonpath = ["backend"]` in `pyproject.toml` made tests work

## Solution Implemented

Added automatic path setup to `backend/__init__.py` following the pattern used in `shared/__init__.py`:

```python
"""
Backend package for Kanakku

This package provides the Flask web application and API for the Kanakku
personal finance management system.
"""

import os
import sys
from pathlib import Path


def setup_backend_paths():
    """
    Set up Python paths for backend imports.
    This ensures that 'app' imports work correctly when the backend
    module is imported from outside the backend directory.
    """
    # Get the backend directory (where this __init__.py is located)
    backend_dir = Path(__file__).parent.absolute()
    
    # Add backend directory to Python path so 'app' imports work
    backend_str = str(backend_dir)
    if backend_str not in sys.path:
        sys.path.insert(0, backend_str)


# Automatically set up paths when this module is imported
setup_backend_paths()

# Version information
__version__ = "1.0.0"
__author__ = "Kanakku Team"
```

## Verification

1. **Direct imports now work**:
   ```bash
   python -c "from backend.app.accounts_bp.routes import accounts_bp; print('Success!')"
   # ✅ Success!
   ```

2. **Multiple module imports work**:
   ```bash
   python -c "from backend.app.transactions_bp.routes import transactions_bp; from backend.app.books_bp.routes import books_bp; print('Success!')"
   # ✅ Success!
   ```

3. **Existing tests still pass**:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest backend/tests/test_config.py -v
   # ✅ All tests pass
   ```

4. **Works from any directory**:
   ```bash
   cd backend && python -c "from app.accounts_bp.routes import accounts_bp; print('Success!')"
   cd .. && python -c "from backend.app.accounts_bp.routes import accounts_bp; print('Success!')"
   # ✅ Both work
   ```

## Key Benefits

- **Backward compatibility**: Existing code and tests continue to work unchanged
- **Forward compatibility**: Backend module can now be imported from anywhere
- **Consistent pattern**: Follows the same approach used in the `shared` module
- **Automatic setup**: No manual path configuration required by users
- **Minimal impact**: Only adds a few lines to `backend/__init__.py`

## Alternative Solutions Considered

1. **Converting to relative imports**: Would require changing 100+ files and could break existing functionality
2. **Updating all import statements**: Would be a massive refactoring effort with high risk
3. **Adding path setup to each problematic file**: Would be repetitive and error-prone

The chosen solution is the most elegant as it:
- Requires minimal code changes (only `backend/__init__.py`)
- Maintains all existing functionality
- Follows established patterns in the codebase
- Provides automatic resolution without user intervention

## Lessons Learned

1. **Monorepo import challenges**: When consolidating multiple packages, import path issues are common
2. **Path setup patterns**: Having a consistent approach to path setup across modules is valuable
3. **Pytest configuration**: The `pythonpath` setting in pytest can mask import issues during testing
4. **Early detection**: Import issues should be tested outside of the test environment to catch them early

## Prevention

- Test module imports from different directories during development
- Consider import patterns when designing package structure
- Document import requirements clearly
- Use consistent path setup patterns across all modules

# Webpack DefinePlugin Conflict in Frontend Build

## Problem

The CI/CD pipeline was failing during the frontend build step with the following error:

```
DefinePlugin
Conflicting values for 'process.env'

DefinePlugin
Conflicting values for 'process.env.NODE_ENV'
```

This was causing the build verification job to fail with exit code 1, preventing successful deployments.

## Root Cause

The issue was in `frontend/webpack-fallbacks.js` where we had added a custom `DefinePlugin` configuration:

```javascript
new webpack.DefinePlugin({
  'process.env': process.env,
})
```

This conflicted with Create React App's built-in `DefinePlugin` that already handles environment variables including `process.env.NODE_ENV`. When webpack tried to merge these configurations, it detected conflicting definitions for the same keys.

## Diagnostic Steps

1. **Analyzed CI logs**: The error clearly indicated a DefinePlugin conflict
2. **Examined webpack configuration**: Found the custom DefinePlugin in `webpack-fallbacks.js`
3. **Identified the conflict**: Create React App already provides environment variable handling
4. **Tested locally**: Confirmed the build failed with the same error locally

## Solution

Removed the conflicting `DefinePlugin` from the webpack configuration in `frontend/webpack-fallbacks.js`:

```diff
  // Add plugins to provide Buffer and process
  config.plugins.push(
    new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
      process: require.resolve("process/browser"),
      Buffer: ['buffer', 'Buffer'],
-   }),
-   new webpack.DefinePlugin({
-     'process.env': process.env,
    })
  );
```

The `ProvidePlugin` is sufficient for providing the `process` and `Buffer` globals needed for browser compatibility, while Create React App's built-in configuration handles environment variables properly.

## Verification

1. **Local build test**: `yarn build` completed successfully
2. **Local test verification**: `yarn test:basic` passed without issues
3. **CI pipeline**: Should now pass the build verification step

## Lessons Learned

- **Avoid duplicating CRA functionality**: Create React App already provides comprehensive webpack configuration including environment variable handling
- **Check for existing plugins**: Before adding webpack plugins, verify they don't conflict with existing configurations
- **Test locally first**: Always test webpack configuration changes locally before pushing to CI
- **Understand the build process**: The DefinePlugin is specifically used by webpack to replace variables at build time, and having multiple definitions for the same variable causes conflicts

## Prevention

- When adding webpack customizations, focus only on what's not already provided by Create React App
- Use CRACO's configuration options that complement rather than override CRA's built-in functionality
- Document any webpack customizations and their purpose clearly

# Kanakku Deployment Summary

The following production-ready files and configurations have been added to prepare Kanakku for deployment:

## Backend

1. **Production Environment Configuration**
   - Created `backend/.env.production` with production-specific settings
   - Set FLASK_ENV to 'production' and FLASK_DEBUG to 0
   - Added placeholders for proper database URLs, mail server settings, etc.

2. **Deployment Script**
   - Added `backend/deploy-production.sh` for automating backend deployment
   - Script handles virtual environment setup, dependency installation, and environment configuration

3. **Production Server**
   - Added Gunicorn to `requirements.txt` for production WSGI serving
   - Created systemd service file (`kanakku.service`) for running as a system service

## Frontend

1. **Production Build Script**
   - Added `frontend/build-production.sh` for creating optimized production builds
   - Script properly sets production environment variables during build

## Deployment Options

1. **Traditional Deployment**
   - Nginx configuration (`nginx-kanakku.conf`) for serving the frontend and proxying API requests
   - Systemd service file for running the backend as a managed service

2. **Docker Deployment**
   - Created `docker-compose.yml` for orchestrating the full stack
   - Added Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend
   - Configured PostgreSQL database container
   - Added healthchecks and proper restart policies

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Configured secure SSL/TLS settings in the Nginx configuration
   - Added security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
   - Created non-root users in Docker containers
   - Set up systemd security features for the service

## Documentation

1. **Deployment Checklist**
   - Created `PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md` with comprehensive steps for deployment
   - Includes pre-deployment, deployment, and post-deployment verification tasks

## Validation

1. **Testing**
   - Verified that all backend and frontend tests pass successfully
   - Confirmed that linting checks pass

## Next Steps

Before actual deployment, ensure:

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Update `.env.production` with actual production values
   - Generate strong, unique secret keys
   - Configure proper database connections

2. **Domain Configuration**
   - Update Nginx configuration with actual domain names
   - Obtain SSL certificates for your domains

3. **Database Setup**
   - Set up a production database (PostgreSQL recommended)
   - Configure backup procedures

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up application and server monitoring
   - Configure log rotation and aggregation

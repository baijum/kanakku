# Version Control & File Management Standards

## Git Best Practices

- Never leave unstaged/untracked files after committing to git
- Don't create new branches unless explicitly requested
- Commit changes in logical, focused units
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages

## Environment & Security

- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Never overwrite `.env` files without first asking and confirming
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files and build artifacts
- Store secrets and configuration in environment variables

## File Management

- Avoid writing one-time scripts in permanent files
- Use descriptive file and directory names
- Keep project structure organized and consistent
- Remove unused files and dependencies regularly

## Code Organization

- Never name files "improved-something" or "refactored-something"
- When refactoring, edit existing files instead of creating duplicates
- Maintain consistent naming conventions across the project
- Group related files in logical directory structures

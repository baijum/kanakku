* When encountering test failures, prioritize updating the test to match the
  intended implementation, rather than changing the implementation to match the test, unless:

    1. The implementation is clearly wrong or inconsistent with requirements
    2. The implementation introduces a security risk or bug
    3. The test correctly reflects the desired behavior documented in requirements

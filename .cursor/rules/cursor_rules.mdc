## Rule Structure
Required structure for all rule files
Each rule file must contain:
- Clear description
- Applicability scope
- Specific requirements
- Examples of correct implementation

Example structure:
```yaml
- name: example_rule
  description: Example rule description
  applies_to: "path/to/files/*.ext"
  always_apply: false
  content: |
    Detailed rule explanation
    - With bullet points
    - And code examples
```
**Applies to:** .windsurf/rules/**/*.yml


## File References
How to reference files in rules
Use standard markdown links for file references
Example: [schema.prisma](../prisma/schema.prisma)


## Code Examples
Format for code examples in rules
Always provide both positive and negative examples:
```typescript
// ✅ DO: Good example
const good = true;

// ❌ DON'T: Bad example
const bad = false;
```


## Content Guidelines
Guidelines for rule content
- Start with high-level overview
- Include specific requirements
- Show implementation examples
- Reference existing code patterns
- Keep rules DRY


## Best Practices
General rule authoring best practices
- Use bullet points for clarity
- Keep descriptions concise
- Include DO/DON'T examples
- Prefer actual code references
- Maintain consistent formatting

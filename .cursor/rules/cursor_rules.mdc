# Cursor Rules Guidelines

## Required Rule Structure

```markdown
---
description: Clear, one-line description of what the rule enforces
globs: path/to/files/*.ext, other/path/**/*
alwaysApply: boolean
---

- **Main Points in Bold**
  - Sub-points with details
  - Examples and explanations
```

## File References

- Use `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` ([filename](mdc:filename)) to reference files
- Example: [prisma.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/prisma.mdc) for rule references
- Example: [schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma) for code references

## Code Examples

- Use language-specific code blocks

```typescript
// ✅ DO: Show good examples
const goodExample = true;

// ❌ DON'T: Show anti-patterns
const badExample = false;
```

## Rule Content Guidelines

- Start with high-level overview
- Include specific, actionable requirements
- Show examples of correct implementation
- Reference existing code when possible
- Keep rules DRY by referencing other rules

## Best Practices

- Use bullet points for clarity
- Keep descriptions concise
- Include both DO and DON'T examples
- Reference actual code over theoretical examples
- Use consistent formatting across rules

## Rule Maintenance

For rule maintenance, improvement processes, and lifecycle management, see [self_improve.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/self_improve.mdc).

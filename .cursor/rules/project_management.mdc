# Project Management & Documentation Standards

## Project Planning & Documentation

- Always check for a PRD (Product Requirements Document) before starting a new task and follow it closely
- Look for comprehensive project documentation to understand requirements before making changes
- Keep a running list of patterns and technology used in the README.md file
- Reference the README.md file for patterns and technology used in the project

## Development Approach

- Focus only on code areas relevant to the assigned task
- Prefer iterating on existing code rather than creating new solutions
- Keep solutions simple and avoid introducing unnecessary complexity
- Make only requested changes or changes you're confident are well understood
- Consider what other code areas might be affected by your changes
- Don't drastically change existing patterns without explicit instruction

## Issue Documentation & Learning

- If you run into issues that take multiple iterations to fix. After you fix it, write up a description of the problem and how we fixed it and store it in a folder called "fixes", in an individual .md file with the name of the issue. Only do this for major issues and solutions
- For issues that are taking multiple iterations to fix, check the fixes folder for previous fixes and see if the same issue has been fixed before

## Documentation Best Practices

- Maintain up-to-date project documentation
- Document architectural decisions and their rationale
- Keep README files current with setup and usage instructions
- Document breaking changes and migration paths
- Use clear, descriptive language in all documentation
